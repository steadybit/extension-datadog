## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need to do this once. If you are submitting a pull request for the first time, just submit a Pull Request and our CLA Bot will give you instructions on how to sign the CLA before merging your Pull Request.

All contributors must sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/steadybit/.github/blob/main/.github/cla/individual-cla.md).

If contributing on behalf of your company, your company must sign a [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/steadybit/.github/blob/main/.github/cla/corporate-cla.md). If so, please contact us via office@steadybit.com.

If for any reason, your first contribution is in a PR created by other contributor, please just add a comment to the PR
with the following text to agree our CLA: "I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA".
